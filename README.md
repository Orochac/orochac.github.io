To buld and run use "bundle exec jekyll serve"

Jekyll is an active open source project that is updated frequently. If the github-pages gem on your computer is out of date with the github-pages gem on the GitHub Pages server, your site may look different when built locally than when published on GitHub. To avoid this, regularly update the github-pages gem on your computer.

    Open Terminal.
    Update the github-pages gem.
        If you installed Bundler, run bundle update github-pages.
        If you don't have Bundler installed, run gem update github-pages.
