Welcome to the first post of my blog. I hope to use this space to post interesting and
informative content on my travels, computer science and mathematics! 

After finishing my Masterâ€™s degree in June I decided to travel south-east Asia and Japan. This is a rough overview of my planned travels.

I fly in from Melbourne to Singapore then make my way from the northernmost point of Sumatra to Jakarta over the span of a month. I then spend 8 days in Vietnam before making my way back to Jakarta to explore Java and the lesser Sunda islands for a month. I will then make my way to Japan and spend a few weeks there before flying to Thailand. There I plan to stay for around two months including some trips to Cambodia and Laos. I will then Return to Melbourne in December. 

The entire trip will span roughly 5 months and will include 8 different countries visited.

I hope to publish weekly updates on my travels as well as slowly adding CV and portfolio resources to the site. 


Stay curious,
