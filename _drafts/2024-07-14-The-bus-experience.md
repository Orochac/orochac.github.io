This story begins with me wanting to find the cheapest way to get to my diving spot in Aceh, Sumatra.
After finding that there are no direct flights from Singapore to Banda Aceh, the capital of the Aceh region and the location of the ferry to Pulau Weh, I decide on catching a bus to KL to then fly direct to Banda Aceh. Attempting to also be as frugal as possible I decide on spending the night on the bus as my "accommodation". In my planning and preparation for the bus I buy a ticket through some odd website that looks a little dodgy but the price of 20SGD seems legit and cheap.

In the following days I enjoy my time in Singapore until
- oneday transit through KL
- looking for visa forms customs ect BC I havent filled anything out
- see that Malaysia is visa free and no customs forms sweet, figure il just be able to fill out anything else at the checkpoint
- fast forward I'm in Singapore thinking I can hold off on data untill I'm in indo
- mall prob big transit hub with counter ect I can ask questions there
-nope I get there after a massive day walked over 15km and it's a two floor tiny mall with a little driveway I think is for my bus
- I spend 3 hours at bk and walking around with a 12kg pack I did no less than 5 laps of this place, I notice all the these people with suitcases in what look to be travel tour type shops, I think that's odd why would they be there with there luggage ok.  I finally go to the bathroom to wash my face.
- the bathroom is outside an there are a bunch of people
- its the bus stop
So I go up to a bus and I'm like I'm the 11pm KL he says not this one later. I'm like fine I'll wait
Fast forward 11:30 I put my bag on a bus show the ticket he says to check in
I'm like ok, what turns out those your shops are the ticket booths what the heck.
I go to check in and they say I need to fill a form and that's not my bus
Oh shit
I sprint back pull my bag out of the bus walk back they say that I need to fill this form and it has in big letters to do this 3 days before entering Malaysia
Oh fuck
No it's ok it's just 3 days is the earliest
Oh good
I need to fill the form online
Fuck
Can I use Ur PC's? No use the terminal behind you. Now in the meantime during this entire putting my bags on the wrong bus there is this slow as fuck son of a bitch filling out his form. What's the bus number la. Bitch it's on the ticket youre holding. She says no data? I don't make bus man wait there is 5min untill it leaves
Oh fuck
She says I can use bk wifi thank god I sprint over fill out this form like a mother fuxker but I get to my acom, I'm not staying I fly out the same day so I say none. Nah form doesn't like that. So I'm panicking 3 min until this bus leaves so I click the button next to finish which is reset.
Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck
I fill this thing out like a god damn deamon I search some random place in KL to put as address and then I submit and sprint back to the booking shop with one min to spare out of breath she's like chill bro drivers right here.
I get on
Delayed the bus 2min if anything.
